    * **Goal:** Quickly get explanations for unfamiliar code snippets.

17. ✅ **Generating Code Snippets with Chat (More Complex):**
    * In the Copilot Chat, describe a more complex code snippet you need (e.g., "Write a Python function that reads data from a CSV file and returns a list of dictionaries.").
    * **Goal:** Practice using the chat for generating larger and more specific code blocks.

18. ✅ **Asking Follow-up Questions in Chat:**
    * After Copilot provides a response in the chat, ask a follow-up question to refine the answer or explore related topics.
